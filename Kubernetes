what is Kubernetes?

it is open source container orchestration tool
Developed by Google
Helps you manage containerized applications

helps you in different deployment environments like 
virtaul, phyiscal and cloud

what problems Kubernetes solves?
trend from monolith to Mircroservices

increased usage of Containers
Demand for a proper way of managing those hundreds of containers

what features do orchestration tools offer?
High Availablitiy o no down time
Scalability or high performance
Disaster recovery -back up and restore

Kubernetes components
Master node
worker nodes

Master Node
  Api Server: UI, API, CLI, entry point to k8s cluster
  Controller Manager:keep track of whats happening in the cluster
  Scheduler:ensure pods placement
  etcd: for back up and restore
  
Note: we need to back up master nodes in case failure, no back up for master nodes 
hard to access cluster infor, in PROD we have to run two master nodes

Node : node means physical server
pod: smallest unit like reall application

Virtual Network: Master nodes and worker nodes communication

Kubernetes Basic Concepts
POD is smalles unit
1 pod per application

Service: pods used to talk to each other using service, even pod replaced service remain same
 1. uses perminanet IP address
 2. Load Balancer
 
 Kubernetes configuration
 API server uses yaml or json for configuration, configuration goes to API server
 Deployment: A template for creating PODS
 
 kubernetes is a Declarative means what we declare in YAML file, it gives us
 is ==should
 
 Kubernetes Components explained! Pods, Services, Secrets, ConfigMap
 
 note: k8s does not manage data persistance.
 voumes are used to store data
 
 statefullset: specifically for database applications as those are statefull
 Deployment: deployment for stateless ie application deployment
 Ingress: 
 Secrets:for passwords, usernames
 configmap:for configurations of application ie application property files
