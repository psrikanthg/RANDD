What is the difference between inner and outer join? Explain with example.
Inner join is the most common type of Join which is used to combine the rows from two 
tables and create a result set containing only such records that are present in
 both the tables based on the joining condition 
If none of the record matches between two tables, then INNER JOIN will return a NULL set
Outer Join

Outer Join, on the other hand, will return matching rows from both tables 
as well as any unmatched rows from one or both the tables 
(based on whether it is single outer or full outer join respectively)

What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
UNION and UNION ALL both unify for add two structurally similar data sets, but UNION operation 
returns only the unique records from the resulting data set whereas 
UNION ALL will return all the rows, even if one or more rows are duplicated to each other.

LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table

RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table

FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
Automatic Locks in DML Operations

A row lock, also called a TX lock, is a lock on a single row of a table. 
A transaction acquires a row lock for each row modified by one of the following statements: 
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and SELECT ... FOR UPDATE. 
The row lock exists until the transaction commits or rolls back.

what is difference between function and procedure in SQL?

	Function																Procedure
A function is used to calculate result using given inputs.		A procedure is used to perform certain task in order.
A function can be called by a procedure.						A procedure cannot be called by a function.
DML statements cannot be executed within a function.			DML statements can be executed within a procedure.
A function can be called within a query.						A procedure cannot be called within a query.
Whenever a function is called, it is first compiled before      A procedure is compiled once and can be called multiple times without being compiled.

A function returns a value and control to calling function      A procedure returns the control but not any value to calling function or code.
or code.

A function has no support for try-catch							A procedure has support for try-catch blocks.

	
A select statement can have a function call.                    A select statement can't have a procedure call.
A function cannot have explicit transaction handling.			A procedure can use explicit transaction handling.
